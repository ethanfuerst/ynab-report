        Join monthly_categories.category_group_id directly to
        category_groups.id — hopping through cleaned.categories would pull the
        latest-snapshot group and mis-attribute historical months for any
        category that has moved between groups. The as-of-month affiliation
        lives on monthly_categories itself.

        activity_usd is negative for spend in YNAB; the next CTE flips the sign
        so a positive number is net outflow.

        Exclude budget months that have not elapsed yet: YNAB pre-creates
        future budget-month rows (zero activity) for scheduled/goal categories,
        which would inflate months_with_data and under-project the current year,
        and would also pull future assignments into the budgeted-fallback
        signal. Keeping only months up to the current month makes
        months_with_data the true count of elapsed months.

        net spend, surfaced for the drilldown table.

        Drop categories whose yearly net activity is an inflow
        (activity_usd_total > 0, i.e. refunds exceed spend). Those would yield
        negative amount_spent / projected and distort pct_of_bucket; they are
        not meaningful "spend" against a Needs/Wants target. Net-spend
        (negative) and zero-activity (budgeted-fallback) categories are kept.

        Clamp the budgeted fallback at 0: a no-spend category can still net a
        negative yearly assignment when leftover dollars are pulled back out of
        it (a de-funding), which would otherwise make signal_year / projected
        negative. A no-spend category never "spent" below zero.
