Overage patches do NOT inflate Needs/Wants targets (buckets stay flagged in core.yearly_bucket_adherence). Savings coverage credits covered (actual-YTD) spend back without raising any target/goal. extra_income_surplus_to_investments is the terminal residual that makes the five outputs conserve to extra_income (notionally the amount left to invest); it has no downstream consumer.'
