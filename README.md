# ynab-report

This is a personal project to help me track my finances.

I use [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) to budget, and this project pulls my budget and transaction data from their API, processes it, and displays it in a Google Sheet.

To run the evidence project locally, run `npm run dev` in the dashboards directory.

To deploy the modal app, run `./deploy_modal.sh`
